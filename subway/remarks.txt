1. Baseline model for time-series prediction. Current prediction is the last value
go with our window selection
train_set shape: 10000,34

train_set : 80
                 10


2. Feature importance ranking. Add explanability
3. Lasso to add regularization and reduce feature number.
4. Add window length exploration for LSTM
